1. Scikit-learn/ML: partial_fit
 - Partial_fit in scikit-learn is a method used for training machine learning models incrementally, which means you can train your model on a large dataset in smaller parts rather than all at once.

2. Scikit-learn/ML:Scikit Metrics
 - This specific part of scikit-learn is dedicated to providing various metrics that you can use to evaluate your models. These metrics can tell you things like how accurate your predictions are, how well your model can distinguish between different classes, and how robust it is to changes in the data.
 - By using the tools provided in sklearn.metrics, you can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of your machine learning models, helping you make informed decisions about how to improve them or choose the best model for your task.
